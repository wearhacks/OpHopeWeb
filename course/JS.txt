make a button
do onclick and display alert box
create function


remember we talked about document and trees while learning HTML, we're finally going to put that to use.

First off, summon your HTML skills and make a webpage with a simple button that says "Click me!" in it.

So far, we've worked with HTML bodies to tell the browser what to display to the user. Let's bring that head we told you about earlier. Just before the <body> tag, place a head tag (remember to close it) like so:

<html>
	<head>
	</head>

	<body>
	</body>
</html>
