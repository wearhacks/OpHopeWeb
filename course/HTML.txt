Recall: the purpose of HTML is to describe what should be rendered by the browser.

The easiest way to make an HTML page that we can view at our browser is to create a 
file that contains HTML code and open it with the browser. We will have you writing some
HTML shortly *right here* though!

Some programming traditions are not to be taken lightly... let alone being broken. 
Writing code that ends up in "Hello world" being displayed on your screen is one of them.
Here is a version of "Hello World" in HTML:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <body>
        <p>Hello world!</p> 
    </body>
</html>

Whoah! Let's see what's going on there:

1. We are telling the browser that this file's ((doc)ument's) content type is HTML: <!DOCTYPE html>
   If it helps, remember document + type = doctype!
2. As if the doctype was not enough, we also have an HTML *tag/element*: <html>...</html>
   All content and annotative data goes in there.
3. Next, we define the *body* of the document. Why a body? Because in HTML pages there is also
   a head as we will see later.
4. Finally, for the actual content, we define a paragraph inside <body> using the <p> tag. 
   It contains the text which will be displayed.

Exercise: Go ahead then, make your own "Hello World" page!
    1. First, type the doctype! (how playful) 
    2. Second, add the <html> element. Remember to match it with a closing one! (</html>)
    3. Next up, <body>. It must go *inside* <html>!
    4. Finally, make a paragraph containing some text inside the body, using <p>.

Think of an HTML page as a family tree. Because we do not put anything except for the doctype 
outside, the <html> element is the ancestor of every other tag in the page: the <body> element 
is one of its children. Similarly, the <p> element is a child of <body>. This concept 
will be important for manipulating HTML pages with small programs (called "scripts") 
written in JavaScript later.

In more technical terms, every HTML document is a "tree". It's first tag (<html>) 
is called the "root element" of the tree. One tag can contain an infinite number of tags as its children. 

We could have put anything we wanted in the body as long as the browser knows what to do with
it. HTML has all sorts of elements you can put in there as long as you (and the browser) know about them. 

Let's take a tour of a few other tags we can use inside HTML pages. While doing that, we
will develop a simple page that will serve as the interface for a money management application.

- Headings: h1, h2, h3, h4. These are usually used for titles and similar content. 
                            They go from h1 up to h4, in order of scope: h1 is the super-heading
                            of h2 and so on. For example:
  <h1>NBA Team Rosters</h1>
  <h2>Eastern Conference</h2>
  <h3>Southeast Division</h3>
  <h4>Atlanta Hawks</h4>

  Exercise: Create the page's main header which displays "Money Manager" using <h1>.
  Exercise: Create a subheader which reads "Transactions" using <h2>.

- Dropdown list: This is used whenever you have a list of values from which the user would 
                 have to choose (one only!). You supply a list of options as <option> tags.
                 Each <option> can have a value *attribute*. Attributes are accompanying HTML
                 elements either to provide additional information to the browser about their 
                 rendering or to provide values that are used by other code (e.g. CSS stylesheets,
                 JavaScript scripts).

                 The "value" attribute in <option> tags, in particular, is used by scripts that are
                 supposed to look at the option that was selected and do something with it. This
                 can be different from the text contained in the tag.

                 A full <select> tag example:
  
  <select name="conference">
    <option disabled selected>Choose a conference:</option>
    <option value="Eastern">Eastern Conference</option>
    <option value="Western">Western Conference</option>
  </select>

  The first <option> in that example serves to indicate to the user that they should select one
  of the other options using the dropdown. So it is selected by default using the "selected" attribute. 
  Since it is not a real option, it is disabled with the "disabled" attribute... and it has no value.

  Exercise: Make a <select> tag to choose between an "Income" and an "Expense" transaction. Name it "transaction_type".
  Exercise: Add 2 options: one for "Income" transactions and one for expenses.
  Exercise: Add an instructive option tag that is disabled and selected by default with the text "Choose a transaction type:"

- Forms: They are used when we want to submit data to another program (usually a script) for processing.
         They consist of a <form> tag that wraps a number of <input> tags which contain the actual
         data that is sent over. The input can be, for example, text fields, radio buttons, buttons...

  <form name="player_submission"> 
      <input type="text" placeholder="First Name" name="first_name">
      <input type="text" placeholder="Last Name" name="last_name">
      <input type="number" placeholder="Jersey Number" name="jersey_number">
      <input type="button" value="Submit">
  </form>

  Notice how the input tags do not contain a matching closing tag because they do not have any actual text content!

  Exercise: Create a form named "new_transaction" to create new transaction entries.
  Exercise: Add an input field that will contain text for the Description of a transaction.
  Exercise: Add an input field that will contain the amount of a transaction.
  Exercise: Finally, create the tag for the button of the form.

- Tables: Tables are used for displaying tabular data: for example, a list of players in a team.
          They consist of <table> which contains <tr> tags for each (t)able (r)ow.
          Inside the rows you can either put a (t)able (h)eader (with <th>) or 
          (t)able (d)ata (with <td>).

  <table>
    <tr>
        <th>First Name</th>
        <th>Last Name</th>
        <th>Number</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Tim</td>
        <td>Hardaway Jr.</td>
        <td>10</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Kirk</td>
        <td>Hinrich</td>
        <td>12</td>
    </tr>
  </table>

  Exercise: Create a table element. It will contain transaction entries.
  Exercise: Create one row for the header.
  Exercise: Create 3 header columns: one for the type of the transaction ("Type"), another for the 
            description ("Description") and a final one for the amount ("Amount").

  Our table will not contain any actual transaction entries yet. We will generate those with a script
  based on the user input!

  You can use some additional elements to better indicate which section is which on your table
  ((head)er, body, (foot)er):
  
  <table>
    <thead>
        <tr>
            <th>First Name</th>
            <th>Last Name</th>
            <th>Number</th>
            <th>Age</th>
        </tr>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Tim</td>
            <td>Hardaway Jr.</td>
            <td>10</td>
            <td>24</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Kirk</td>
            <td>Hinrich</td>
            <td>12</td>
            <td>35</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
    <tfoot>
        <tr>
            <td>Average Age</td>
            <td>29.5</td>
        <tr>
    </tfoot>
  </table>

  Exercise: Wrap the existing table row into a header section.
  Exercise: Although we have no transactions yet, create a body section on the table
            to indicate where they will go.
  Exercise: Create a footer section which will contain the current balance (incomes - expenses):
            - Create the footer section
            - Create a table row
            - Create 2 data columns, one that contains the text "Balance:" and another that will 
              contain the calculated balance.

That wraps it up for the static content of our page. Although all the elements
we need are there, you are probably not very impressed by how it looks, are you?
Let's make it a bit prettier with CSS!
